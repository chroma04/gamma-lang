# Compiler architecture

This document describes how the reference implementation of Gamma is organized:
the stages a program passes through, where each stage lives, and the invariants
that connect them. Parts marked *(planned)* are designed but not yet implemented.

```

### Why an interpreter *and* a code generator

Gamma requires compile-time evaluation of ordinary functions (spec §17): array
lengths, top-level constants and arguments for compile-time parameters are
computed by running Gamma code inside the compiler, with every checked operation
checked and undefined behavior detected. The interpreter that does this works on
the same typed IR as the code generator, so it is also used to run programs
directly (`gamma run`), which gives a fast development loop and a reference
semantics that the native back end is tested against.

### Why C as the native target

Generating C keeps the implementation portable and lets the system C compiler do
register allocation and optimization. The features that C cannot express
directly are provided by a small runtime library: stack switching for fibers
(spec §14), arithmetic on integers wider than 128 bits, and trap reporting. The
effect system compiles to *evidence passing* and *exit flags* (spec Appendix D),
which are plain C.

### Demand-driven semantic analysis *(planned)*

Type checking and compile-time evaluation depend on each other: checking
`buf: [BLOCK * 2]u8` needs the value of `BLOCK`, which may be computed by a
function that must itself be checked first. Semantic analysis is therefore
demand-driven: each top-level declaration is checked when it is first needed,
and a declaration that is requested while it is being checked is a dependency
cycle, reported with every declaration in it (spec §3.4).

## Front end

### Lexer

The lexer turns UTF-8 source into tokens and decides which newlines are
significant (spec §2.8), so the parser sees a `Newline` token exactly where a
statement or declaration may end. It keeps a stack of open brackets: inside
`( )` and `[ ]` newlines are dropped; inside `{ }` and at top level they are kept
unless the previous token is a binary operator (or another token that cannot end
an expression) or the next line begins with `else`, `and`, `or` or `.name`. A
`{ }` that is the body of a `match` is tracked separately, because there every
line starts a new arm.

The lexer also forms the two-word operators `is not` and `not in`, records `///`
documentation comments, and computes the exact values of literals: integers as
unbounded naturals and floats as exact rationals, since literals are typed and
rounded later (spec §6.1).

### Parser

The parser is a hand-written recursive-descent parser with precedence climbing
for expressions. Gamma treats types as compile-time values, so the syntax tree
has a single expression type that also covers type syntax (`?T`, `[]T`,
`fn(…) -> R`, `struct { … }`, …).

A few constructs cannot be classified by syntax alone; the parser builds one node
and leaves the decision to name resolution (spec §A.7):

- `E!T` (error-union type) versus `x!` (unwrap) followed by more postfix
  operators: the parser attempts to parse a type after `!` and, if that
  succeeds, produces a `Bang` node.
- `?T(x)` and `[3]u8(1, 2, 3)`: a prefix type operator applies to the following
  postfix expression, including a call; whether that call is a generic type
  application (`?List(u8)`) or a construction is known only after resolution.
- The right operand of `is` is parsed as an expression and turned into a pattern
  when it contains `_` or a variant without its payload.

Other ambiguities are resolved syntactically: the first `{` after the head of an
`if`, `while`, `for`, `match`, `with` or `when` always begins its body, and a
label in `break L` is recognized because the parser tracks the labels of the
enclosing loops.

Every node carries a `NodeId`, unique within a compilation, so later stages can
attach types and other facts in side tables instead of mutating the tree.

## Diagnostics

All stages report problems to a shared `Diagnostics` collector. Messages are
lowercase and specific. The `--diag-format=short` flag prints one
`path:line:col: severity: message` line per diagnostic, which is what the test
suite matches against.
